# I Build AI Systems That Actually Work in the Real World

Most AI demos look impressive — until they fail under real usage.

I design and test AI-powered systems that businesses can rely on:
clear logic, known failure modes, and outputs that don’t fall apart outside a demo.

This portfolio shows exactly how I approach AI — from problem framing to testing and delivery.

## What I Help With

If you are:
- Using AI but getting inconsistent or unreliable outputs
- Trying to automate content, decisions, or workflows with AI
- Shipping AI features without knowing where they break

This is what I build:

- AI agents for content, automation, and decision support  
- Prompt systems with structure, validation, and guardrails  
- End-to-end AI workflows (not isolated prompts)  
- Testing strategies for AI-driven products  

No hype. No “magic AI.” Just systems that hold up under use.

## Proof of Work (Case Studies)

Each case study below breaks down:
- The real problem
- The risks most people ignore
- The system design
- How reliability was tested
- What worked and what didn’t

- [AI Meal & Calorie Analyzer](case-studies/ai-calorie-analyzer.md)  
- [AI UGC Prompt Engine](case-studies/ugc-prompt-engine.md)  
- [Social Media AI Automation Agent](case-studies/social-media-ai-agent.md)

## How I Think About AI

AI is not the product.  
AI is a component inside a system.

So I design AI the same way I’d design production software:
- Define failure modes before shipping
- Test beyond happy paths
- Control inputs and outputs
- Keep humans in the loop where it matters

That’s how AI becomes useful instead of risky.
