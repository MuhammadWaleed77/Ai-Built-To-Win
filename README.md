# I Build AI Systems That Actually Solve Real Problems — Not Demos

Most AI tools look impressive until they fail in real use.  
I design AI systems that **work reliably**, solve your toughest problems, and deliver measurable results — from automation and decision-making to full SaaS solutions.

This portfolio shows how I take a problem, design a solution, and **make AI actually do the work**.

## How I Approach AI

AI is a **tool, not the product**.  
The product is **real-world outcomes**.  

Here’s my method:  

1. **Define the problem & outcome first** — what does success actually look like?  
2. **Design AI inside a reliable system** — structured inputs, predictable outputs, fail-safes.  
3. **Test beyond happy paths** — edge cases, errors, and unusual inputs are handled.  
4. **Deliver working solutions** — from AI agents to fully functional SaaS applications.  

> The goal: your business gets measurable results, quickly, without AI “surprises.”
