## Overview

Most image-generation tools give you generic, uninspired outputs.  
I built a **custom GPT-powered prompt engine** that generates **high-quality, photorealistic image prompts** for ads, lifestyle branding, and UGC campaigns.  

- Works for **brands, marketers, content creators, and agencies**  
- Produces **ready-to-use, high-conversion prompts** for AI image generators  
- Ensures outputs are **photorealistic, commercial-ready, and contextually accurate**  

This portfolio piece demonstrates how I turn AI into a **practical tool that solves creative problems at scale**.

## Problem

Brands and creators struggle with:

- Producing **consistent, high-quality AI-generated images** for campaigns  
- Getting **UGC-style imagery** that looks natural and authentic  
- Avoiding **fake-looking or low-quality renders** that hurt conversion  

Most tools require **manual prompt engineering**, trial-and-error, or result in **images that aren’t ad-ready**.

---

## My Solution

I created a **GPT-based AI system** that generates **optimized image prompts** automatically:

1. Understand the product, scene, and desired style  
2. Structure a prompt for **photorealistic, UGC-style, ad-ready images**  
3. Include **composition, lighting, camera, and subject details**  
4. Add **negative prompts** to eliminate errors or unrealistic outputs  

✅ The result: prompts that consistently produce **high-quality images ready for marketing campaigns**.

## What I Built

- **Custom GPT engine** trained/tuned for image prompt generation  
- **Pre-defined templates** for UGC, lifestyle, product photography  
- **Structured outputs** including scene, subjects, composition, lighting, camera settings, and negative prompts  
- **High-conversion focus** — prompts designed to maximize realism and engagement
