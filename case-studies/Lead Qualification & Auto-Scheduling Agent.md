# AI Lead Qualification & Auto-Scheduling Agent — Turn Every Lead Into Revenue

---

## Overview

Most lead forms are useless. They collect emails and leave your **high-value prospects sitting in a queue**, while low-intent leads waste your sales team’s time.  

I built an **AI-powered, end-to-end lead system** that doesn’t just capture leads — it **analyzes, scores, qualifies, and books calls automatically**, in real time.  

- High-intent leads get **immediate attention**  
- Low-intent leads are **stored and nurtured** without bothering sales  
- Full **SaaS workflow from form → AI → calendar → email**  

This is **real automation with measurable revenue impact**, not just another form.

## Website / UI

Here’s how the system looks and works in the real world:

### 1️⃣ Landing Page

*Lead generation starts here. Every visitor has a clear, structured form ready for AI evaluation.*

---

### 2️⃣ Services Page

*High-value offerings are clearly displayed. The AI form integrates seamlessly for contextual lead capture.*

### 3️⃣ Contact / Form Page

*Form submission triggers AI scoring instantly — no human intervention, no delays.*

## How It Works — The AI Edge

1. **Form submission** → structured lead data captured  
2. **AI scoring & intent analysis** → Hot / Warm / Cold / Very Cold  
3. **Decision engine** triggers automatically:
   - Hot lead → **schedule call + send personalized email**  
   - Warm → logged and monitored  
   - Cold → stored for future nurturing  
4. **Calendar integration** ensures no conflicts, instant meeting booking  
5. **Email automation** confirms call + informs sales team  

✅ Every high-value lead gets a **real conversation scheduled**, every low-value lead is captured for future monetization.
