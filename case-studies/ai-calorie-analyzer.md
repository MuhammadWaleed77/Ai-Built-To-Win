## Overview

Most “calorie apps” look flashy but fail in real-world use.  
I built an AI system that **actually works**: upload a meal image, and it instantly returns **accurate calories, protein, carbs, and fat** — structured, actionable, and reliable.  

- Works for **any user**: fitness enthusiasts, diet planners, nutrition coaches, or doctors  
- Handles **complex meals and local foods**  
- Designed for **real-world use, not just a demo**

This portfolio piece shows how I take a problem, build an AI system to solve it, and **guarantee results**.

## The Problem

Existing solutions fail because:

- Portions, angles, and plating vary wildly  
- Mixed or uncommon dishes confuse models  
- Outputs often hide uncertainty, leaving users guessing  

Result: most apps give **wrong numbers or vague results**, wasting time and trust.

---

## My Solution

I designed a **reliable workflow** to handle real-world meals:

1. **Image normalization** – ensures consistent size & quality  
2. **AI food identification** – detects ingredients even in mixed plates  
3. **Structured output generation** – calculates calories, protein, carbs, and fat  
4. **Confidence scoring** – flags uncertain predictions for clarity  

✅ Even in demo mode, this system **produces results you can trust**.

## What I Built

- **Minimal, intuitive UI** for uploading meal images  
- **Backend AI engine** that processes images and returns structured nutrition data  
- **Outputs per item and totals**, clearly formatted for instant understanding  
- **Edge-case handling**, so uncommon foods or unusual meals don’t break the system
