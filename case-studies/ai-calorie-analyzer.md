## Overview
A working AI system that instantly turns food images into **accurate calorie and macronutrient breakdowns**.  
Upload a meal, get results — no guesswork. Built and tested end-to-end by me.

Users can upload a meal image and receive a structured, actionable breakdown of calories, protein, carbs, and fat immediately. All outputs are generated by the system I built and tested.

Designed for **anyone who wants quick nutritional insights**  from fitness enthusiasts and diet planners to general users, nutrition coaches, and doctors.

This tool demonstrates how AI can turn images into actionable information while keeping outputs structured and readable.

## Problem
People want instant calorie and nutrition estimates from food images.  
Existing solutions fail because:

- Portion sizes and angles are ambiguous  
- Mixed dishes are hard to parse  
- Local or uncommon foods often break the model  

The result: most apps either give **wrong numbers** or **hide uncertainty entirely**, leaving users guessing.

---

## Solution Architecture
The AI system is built as a simple, reliable workflow:

1. **Image input normalization**  ensures consistent image size and quality  
2. **AI food identification**  recognizes foods on the plate  
3. **Structured output generation**  calculates calories, protein, carbs, and fat  
4. **Confidence scoring**  flags uncertain predictions for clarity  

Even as a demo, the system provides users a **clear, easy to read breakdown** of their meals.


## What I Built
- A minimal UI for uploading food images  
- Backend AI based logic to process images and return structured nutrition data  
- Outputs that show calories and macronutrient breakdown per item  
- Clear formatting to help users immediately understand results
