# **RealtorBot — AI Real Estate Assistant: Turning Leads into Property Deals**

---

## **Overview**

The traditional property search and lead qualification process  is **fragmented**, **time-consuming**, and **inefficient**. Buyers, renters, and investors browse multiple listings, reach out to agents via WhatsApp, and wait days for responses.

I built **RealtorBot**, an **AI-powered end-to-end real estate assistant** that doesn’t just capture leads — it **qualifies**, **matches**, and **hands off qualified leads to agents automatically**, in real time.

- **Buyers, renters, and investors** get **fast, relevant property suggestions**
- **Lead qualification happens instantly**, based on user preferences
- **Agents get high-quality, ready-to-close leads** without wasting time on cold prospects
- **AI** handles everything from chat-based property searches to automatic agent notifications

This is **AI-driven lead qualification** that **speeds up the real estate process**, increases lead conversion, and ensures no one misses out on a property.

## **How It Works — The AI Edge**

1. **User Query** → User enters a query or preference about properties  
2. **AI Qualification** → The AI asks follow-up questions (if needed) and qualifies the lead based on intent:  
   - **Hot leads**: Ready to buy, rent, or invest now  
   - **Warm leads**: Interested, but not urgent  
   - **Cold leads**: Browsing or uncertain  
3. **Property Search & Matching** → AI queries a structured database for properties based on user filters (location, budget, bedrooms, etc.)
4. **Agent Notification** → If the lead is hot, an automatic notification is sent to the agent with the lead’s summary and details of matched properties.
5. **Instant Handoff** → High-value leads get immediate attention from agents via **WhatsApp or email** — no delays, no wasted time.

✅ Every **qualified lead** is **delivered instantly** to agents, ready for follow-up.
